	// Multiple inheritance means to call a method to different class and if it is allowed
	// then many doubt will occur so to prevent the ambiguity and due to diamond shape, multiple inheritance is not allowed in Java.
	
		// eg: if class B extends class A and class C and both the classes A, C have same method display() 
		// then compiler cannot decide which display method it should inherit so compilation error occurs.
	// any number of interfaces with one class extend can be used to solve this.
	
	
	// Constructor overloading: more than one constructor with different parameters that every constructor can perform different tasks
